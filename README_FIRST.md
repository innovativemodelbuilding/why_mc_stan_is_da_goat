MOST IMPORTANT - DO NOT MOVE/CHANGE/RENAME OR ANYTHING TO THE 'docs' FOLDER AND 'CNAME' FILE

All images go into assets, divide all artists images with diff folders, if youre taking stans pics put them in mc stan folder, if its website related pics put them in diff folder, everything should be organised well so we can find what we want easily. Same with html,css, and java files.
