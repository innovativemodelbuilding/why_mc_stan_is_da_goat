      <!-- Introduction / Lead -->
      <section id="introduction">
  <p>
    Everyone slept on the fact that a legend was born on 30 August 1999 as Altaf Shaikh, they were unaware who has stepped on this God's green earth, grinding in Pune’s Tadiwala Road slums before flipping his fate into a movement. Fraud individuals tried to knock him down when he first stepped up. Emiway Bantai dissed him, people clownin’ in comments, saying he fell off before he even got a chance, but my GOAT didn’t flinch or fold. He ain’t never chased clout or tried to impress the industry, he just stayed real, stayed focused, and let his art talk louder than the hate.
  </p>
  <p>
    Started off with qawwali, then switched lanes and brought a whole new sound to Desi hip-hop—pain, poetry, reality, philosophy, all raw and untouched. When he dropped tracks like “Astagfirullah” and then the iconic Album Tadipaar, the whole game shifted. His music wasn’t just beats—it was his life, his struggles, where he came from, his voice in a world that tried to mute him. While others were busy beefing, clout chasing, Stan was building a legacy brick by brick, track by track. And then the 2021 run? Insane. Back-to-back heat, no skips, no gimmicks. Every song had a purpose, every bar had weight.
  </p>
  <p>
    By 2022, Insaan came through and showed he ain’t just a rapper—he a thinker. He talked about existence, betrayal, loyalty, and life in a way nobody else was doing. That ain’t regular rapper talk, that’s GOAT talk. He went from being an outsider to winning Bigg Boss 16 on his own vibe—never switched up, never catered to nobody. His insta lives? Legendary. No filter, only real shit. Whether he’s spitting facts, talking spiritual, or just vibin’ with fans, you can’t fake that level of real. That’s why people ride for him—not just ‘cause of the music, but ‘cause the person he is’ a basti boy made the world listen. MC Stan ain’t just part of the culture—he is the culture. A living statement that being yourself in a world that wants you to act fake is the realest flex of all.
  </p>

<section id="early-life">
  <h2>Early life</h2>
  <p>
    Altaf Shaikh popped into this world on 16 October 1999 in Pune’s Tadiwala Road slums, born to a bus driver turned cop and a mother holding it down at home. He grew up in a cramped room where every day felt like a hustle and survival taught him lessons most never see. From the jump he saw how dreams and struggle run side by side and learned that if you want change you gotta fight for it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Around age 12 he was singing qawwali at small gigs, feeling that vibe of devotion and life’s fragility. Then his brother slid him hip hop tracks from Tupac Eminem Lil Wayne Young Thug and others and he recognized his own grind in those beats. School felt like a trap so he chose the mic over textbooks. Nights in cyber cafes meant downloading beats learning flows and jumping into underground cyphers. Those battles were more than shows they were training ground for a voice spitting raw truth from the basti.
  </p>
  <p>
    To score studio time and make DIY videos he hustled nonstop performing anywhere he could even if the crowd was small. He pushed tracks through WhatsApp groups and early YouTube waves while others chased easy paths. Every setback became fuel every doubt turned into fuel. Before the world knew his name MC Stan already had built his fortress from pain self belief and relentless grind. That street forged identity set him up to flip his story into a movement when he finally blew up.
